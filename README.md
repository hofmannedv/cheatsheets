# About Cheatsheets

Learning to maintain a Linux system is not difficult -- especially with the right 
information about everyday tools at hand. These cheatsheets include overviews of 
the following UNIX/Linux tools:

- [Vi/Vim text editor](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/vim)
- [Working with Bash](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/bash)
- [Package management under Debian GNU/Linux, and Ubuntu](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/debian-package-management)
- [Package management under Red Hat Linux, Fedora, and CentOS](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/redhat-package-management)
- [Essential commands for Linux](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/linux-commands)
- [How to use the Nano text editor](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/nano)
- [Keyboard layouts](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/keyboard)
- [Keyboard shortcuts for the Mozilla Firefox webbrowser](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/keyboard-firefox)

I use these in my Linux training courses as an aid and learning material.

In preparation are cheatsheets for the following tools:

- Subcommands for the revision control system Git
- Keyboard shortcuts for the Chromium webbrowser
- Keyboard shortcuts for the Links webbrowser

## Availability

Currently, these cheatsheets are available as single PDF documents in the 
following languages:

- German
- English
- French
- Russian (for Bash shortcuts, only)

## A Note On Preview Of The Cheatsheets

I observed that Mozilla Firefox struggles to display the stored PDF cheatsheets directly on the Github page. This includes the version 115 that is delivered with Debian GNU/Linux 12. As workarounds, either download the PDF file, or use a different webbrowser like Chromium to display it.

## Printed Versions

These cheatsheets are available as printed versions, too, and include additional 
sheets for your notes. Suitable as training material for Linux courses and 
preparation for obtaining a Linux certificate.

Currently, these cheatsheets are included:

- Vi/Vim text editor
- How to use the Nano text editor
- Working with Bash
- Essential commands for Linux
- Package management under Debian GNU/Linux, and Ubuntu
- Package management under RedHat Linux, and Fedora Linux

50 pages, coloured, including 30 pages of cheatsheets.
