# About Cheatsheets

Learning to maintain a Linux system is not difficult -- especially with the right information about everyday tools. These cheatsheets include overviews of the following UNIX/Linux tools:

- [Vi/Vim text editor](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/vim)
- [Working with Bash](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/bash)
- [Package management under Debian GNU/Linux, and Ubuntu](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/debian-package-management)
- [Package management under Red Hat Linux, Fedora, and CentOS](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/redhat-package-management)
- [Essential commands for Linux](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/linux-commands)
- [How to use the Nano text editor](https://github.com/hofmannedv/cheatsheets/tree/master/nano)

I use these in my Linux training courses as an aid and learning material.
